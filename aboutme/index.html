        Hey Everyone!! My name is Josh Scott and I'm from Danville, California (which is about 30 mins east of SF). 
        Here you have a picture with myself, my wife Krystal, and our fur baby Jack!
        We're celebrating our 5th year anniversary this summer!!
        We are currently living in Rexburg and are heading to the Seattle area when I finish school in a year!
        After being at this school for many, many years now and switching my major 3 times, I've finally found my calling in life through Computer Science.
        I'm pursuing a career in Video Game Development and very strongly want to start my own Game Studio at some point down the road.
        I started a YouTube and Twitch channel as a hobby in this past year and it's been a crazy fun time! (The Scott Clan) Go check it out!
        Something that my wife told me when I came to her last year not nowing what to do with school and potential careers, 
        she said "Life is too short, you do NOT want to wake up one day at 45 and realize you made a mistake, follow your dreams!"
        So that's my message to you now, if you're struggling to know what to do in your schooling and career, follow your dreams!
